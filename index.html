    <p class="first stanza">
      The mere sight of you,<br>
      Has my mind & heart brewing<br>
      A concoction so intoxicating<br>
      Making one wish the rush never fades,<br>
      Soaking the euphoric pulses to the bone<br>
      Any sick or soreness, gone away just by the<br>
      Touch you behold<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Hold me in your firmest grip,<br>
      With your rose petal hands<br>
      Smothering me, gasping for you<br>
      Oh my woman, what is it that you<br>
      Possess that my body and soul,<br>
      Screams instabliably for you<br>
      Please don't go,<br>
      There is no light,<br>
      Shinging through my cracked exterior<br>
      Seeping through to my soul...<br>
      
      I'm not a perfect person<br>
      There's many things I wish I didn't do<br>
      But I continue learning <br>
      I never meant to do those things to you,<br>
      So I have to say<br>
      I've found a reason for me<br>
      To change who I used to be<br>
      A reason to start over new<br>
      And the reason is you...<br>
      
      For my life with you, with myself<br> 
      For all the endless dreams,<br>
      I wish to fulfill with you,<br>
      I want to be a better man,<br>
      A man you truly deserve,<br>
      The one I can be, For you<br>
      My Uncut Gem<br>
      Shining and glimmering, through the rains and storms<br>
      Still be the sunshine to light up anyones day...<br>
      Light up mine, My Mighty Sunshine...
